Theology, the study of religion and God, has roots in both classical philosophy and religious traditions (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology; https://www.britannica.com/topic/theology/Relationship-to-philosophy). It examines beliefs and concepts of the divine. \n\nAcross different religions, definitions of God vary. While a comprehensive overview is beyond the scope of currently available information, theological frameworks exist within Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, and Buddhism, though the latter may not utilize a direct equivalent of the theistic God concept.\n\nPhilosophically, arguments for God’s existence include the ontological and cosmological arguments, while the problem of evil presents a challenge to theistic belief. \n\nHistorically, the concept of God has evolved from ancient polytheism to modern conceptions.
