Early philosophical influences, such as Aristotelianism and Hermeticism, laid groundwork for later theological developments [S1]. Major world religions, including Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, each possess unique conceptions of God, often emphasizing attributes like transcendence, immanence, omnipotence, and benevolence [S1, S2, S4].\n\nPhilosophical arguments concerning God’s existence have been proposed for centuries. The ontological argument, for example, attempts to demonstrate God’s existence through reason and logic [S5]. However, arguments against God’s existence, such as the problem of evil, also exist [S3].\n\nGenerally, God is conceived as a supreme being, though understandings of this being vary. Some believe in a single, all-powerful God (monotheism), while others recognize multiple gods (polytheism) or view God as inherent in the universe itself (pantheism) [S3]. The nature of God – whether defined by attributes like omniscience, omnipresence, or simply as a creative force – remains a subject of ongoing debate and personal belief [S3].", "plots_base64": [], "trace": {"total_events": 20, "total_errors": 0, "duration": 52.138749}, "tool_errors": []}}, "trace_only": true}
