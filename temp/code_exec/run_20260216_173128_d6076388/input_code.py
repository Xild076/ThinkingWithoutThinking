result = 'Design an experiment to distinguish diffusion-limited vs reaction-limited kinetics: - Controls: blank catalyst, non-catalytic control, constant temperature control. - Measurable observable: reactant conversion vs time, reaction rate, concentration profiles. - Confounders: temperature gradients, mass transfer limitations, impurity effects. Conclusion: Compare observed kinetics under controlled conditions to attribute limitation.'; print(result)
