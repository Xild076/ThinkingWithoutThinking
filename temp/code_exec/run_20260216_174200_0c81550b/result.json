{"success": true, "output": "Design a fault\u2011tolerant telemetry ingestion architecture for 200k events/sec across two regions with exactly\u2011once semantics. Key components: 1) Distributed message broker (e.g., Kafka) with replication across regions; 2) Stream processing using exactly\u2011once semantics (Kafka Streams or Flink); 3) Idempotent writers to downstream stores; 4) Two\u2011phase commit or transactional writes for cross\u2011region consistency; 5) Monitoring and automatic failover. Compromises: \u2022 Use of at\u2011least\u2011once delivery with idempotent downstream handling to simplify exactly\u2011once guarantees; \u2022 Limited cross\u2011region transaction latency by batching; \u2022 Rely on external broker durability rather than custom transactional log; \u2022 Trade\u2011off between throughput and strict exactly\u2011once by accepting occasional duplicate processing if downstream can deduplicate.", "result": null, "plots": [], "error": null}
