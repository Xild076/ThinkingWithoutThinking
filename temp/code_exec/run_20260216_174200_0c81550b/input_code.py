result = '''Design a fault‑tolerant telemetry ingestion architecture for 200k events/sec across two regions with exactly‑once semantics. Key components: 1) Distributed message broker (e.g., Kafka) with replication across regions; 2) Stream processing using exactly‑once semantics (Kafka Streams or Flink); 3) Idempotent writers to downstream stores; 4) Two‑phase commit or transactional writes for cross‑region consistency; 5) Monitoring and automatic failover. Compromises: • Use of at‑least‑once delivery with idempotent downstream handling to simplify exactly‑once guarantees; • Limited cross‑region transaction latency by batching; • Rely on external broker durability rather than custom transactional log; • Trade‑off between throughput and strict exactly‑once by accepting occasional duplicate processing if downstream can deduplicate.'''; print(result)
