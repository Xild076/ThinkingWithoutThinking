result = "Design an experiment to distinguish diffusion-limited vs reaction-limited kinetics:\n- Controls: blank catalyst, non-catalytic control, constant temperature control.\n- Measurable observable: reactant conversion vs time, reaction rate, concentration profiles.\n- Confounders: temperature gradients, mass transfer limitations, impurity effects.\nConclusion: Compare observed kinetics under controlled conditions to attribute limitation.\n"\nprint(result)
